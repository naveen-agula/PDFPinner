    <string name="why_is_this_happening">There are several different versions of Android. There are several manufacturers who modify their OS and this bring unpredictability in implementing the feature. Different OS provide different URI (required to launch the file from shortcut) and app handles most of the URIs but still there\'s chance some cases are left out.</string>
    <string name="how_to_solve_title">How to Solve?</string>
    <string name="how_to_solve">To solve the issue, you need to edit the file URI manually. This isn\'t difficult considering the fact that URI is just a format of file path.\n\nWhen selecting the file in main interface, press the icon besides the pencil icon. Then check if the file path is similar to what's shown there. Edit as per the requirement.</string>
